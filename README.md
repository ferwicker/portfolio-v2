# Fer Wicker Portfolio

This project presents my recent work as a web developer and designer in a fun and clean website that shows some of my style and personality. It was a fun and interesting project, updating the previous version of my portfolio.

## Motivation
Having an up to date and good looking portfolio is essential for all creatives and especially web developers. It is a fun porject and a chance to feature your skills in their best light. 

## Process
The process of updating the portfolio started with a review of the content in the previous version. I decided to simplify the content a lot and leave focus on the projects. 

I also refreshed the look and feel, with new hero image, colours and fonts, and added a project page for each of the featured items.

I used Javascript to set the link to the download button accross all pages. Since my resume is likely to be updated soon, this allows me to only change the link in one instance instead of several across all pages and avoids future errors.

## Built with
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/xd.html) (prototyping)

## Features
- Cool design
- About me section
- Downloadable Resume
- Project pages

## Roadmap
Skills and projects are always evolving. To make the updating of this project seamless, I plan to have new projects generated dynamically with Javascript in the near future.
